drowsy mind map generator
	positioning
		searches end nodes first to get the necessary spacing for the branches
		size of text depends on range of values
			smallest node should be 11pt and the rest of the nodes should go up from that
	file format
		there should be a root name with lines for each node
		a node should be demoted by tabs on the left size of the line
			each tab is one demotion from the base node(s)
		all ending whitespaces is trimmed
		all whitespace-only lines are ignored
	appearance
		all the text for nodes should be in the foreground of a gray circle
			the gray circle should have a darker grey outline
			the text should be darker than the grey outline
		branches should be the same color as the outline of the circle
